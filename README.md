## Getting started

If you would like to create a local version of Freepee:

```ruby
git clone https://github.com/mklemme/freepee.git
```

Since we are using API keys, you will need to add your own using the gem, Figaro.

Add Figaro to your gemfile

```ruby
gem 'figaro'
```

Run the bundle command to install it.

Next, you need to run the Figaro generator:

```console
figaro install
```

Add API keys to the file Figaro generated in `config/application.yml`. This app expects these API values defined:

```ruby
mandrill_username: mandrill_login
mandrill_api: api-key_abcdef123456
```

Create local instance of the database:

```console
rake db:create && rake db:migrate
```
