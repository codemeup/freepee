<h1>Global#about</h1>
<p>FreePee Club is an application and online community to help people find the cleanest, closest restroom. For many with digestive issues, this is no laughing matter. Our app provides peace of mind and relief.</p> 

<p>We draw our data about restrooms from commercial and governmental databases. Our app also lets the community update information about restrooms so that users have the latest data.</p>

<p>FreePee Club originated as a project among four students at General Assembly. They completed the application as part of required work for the Web Development Immersive course, September 2014 class.</p>
